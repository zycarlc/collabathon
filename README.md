## General Assembly - first collab-athon

In the project, our mission was to create our very own product development agency website from scratch.

### About the Team

UX Design team: Lucy Gao, Eileen Zhang, and Jessica Hombre. Together, we dived into the assigned problem space, exchanged design ideas, discussed technical feasibility, and ultimately came up with a mobile-first site for our agency called ‘DesignHive’. With our collective efforts, we prepared and delivered an engaging pitch that led us to win 'Best Pitch' Award!
